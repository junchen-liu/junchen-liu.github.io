About me
======
I am a graduate student from Boston University majored in Computer Science. Having a good understanding of both application and theory, I have a great interest in software development as well as data engineering. As a cs major student, I am on the track of data-centric computing from which I take Distributed System, Stream System, DB architecture as well as OOD design and graduate algorithm. Familiar with Java, C++, and Go, I can be a great team member and write efficient code. 

Before my master's study, I completed a 6-month internship with Renliwo Network, where I honed my full-stack development skills. Ideally, I would like to continue to specialize in software engineering in the area including web app dev., data infra. engineering and system engineering.

BCNC | Asian Impact & Equity (In progess)
------
*About BCNC: Since 1969, Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center (BCNC) 
has been a vital presence in Greater Boston and beyond, empowering Asians and new immigrants to build healthy families, achieve greater economic success, 
and contribute to thriving communities.*

*Background*

There is a lack of access and understanding around Asian data around 
the social determinants and outcomes of health. 
Partly it is due to the Model Minority Myth as well as the challenge of 
the diversity of who makes up the category "Asian" and "Asian American." 
Over the last 12 to 18 months during the COVID pandemic as well as the 
increase in attention to Black Lives Matter and racial equity, 
focus and data on the impact of racism and inequity has been limited. 
Article after article about education, health, 
economics focused on some communities of color while leaving out or 
not considering Asian data. With there being the widest range of income 
inequality in the Asian community, the issue is complex. 

*Work*

Making Asian data using the recent Census, 
American Community Survey data, and other resources more 
available to nonprofits, organizers, policy makers, elected officials, 
academics, and average citizens. 

*Inspiration*

The MetroWest Foundation's Initiative 
"Impact MetroWest'', a website that 
allows for one to easily access and "slice and dice" the data so for 
example, one can drill down to the needs of different parts of the Asian diaspora. Vietnamese immigrants 
and Chinese Immigrants are different from Taiwanese immigrants.
